<head><title>A very *alert* app</title></head>
<body>
  All this app does is throw an alert at load time to test that
  window.alert() works as you would expect.
</body>
<script>
// if you alert right at page load time, it breaks the world, badly
try {
  alert("this alert will cause an error, sadly");
} catch(e) {
  console.log("alert raised an exception: " + e);
}
setTimeout(function() {alert("this is the alert we were talking about")}, 1);
</script>
